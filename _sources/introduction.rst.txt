Introduction
============

The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a powerful toolkit that facilitates
various types of chemical simulations by providing an object‐oriented interface
for representing and manipulating groups of atoms. ASE’s flexibility has enabled
numerous successful projects, particularly in the fields of physical chemistry,
and materials science. However, when it comes to post‐simulation analysis—especially
for analyzing diverse simulation trajectories—existing tools often fall short.

CRISP (**C**\ omprehensive **R**\ epository for **I**\ nsightful **S**\ imulation **P**\ ost-processing) 
aims to fill this
gap by offering a seamless workflow from simulation to analysis, enabling researchers 
to extract meaningful insights without juggling multiple scripts. It's features are,

- **User-friendly**: Optimized for ease of use with detailed examples and extensive outputs 
  that support nuanced data analysis.
- **Highly parallelized**: Employs parallelization techniques that scale linearly 
  with the number of CPU cores, enabling rapid analysis of large systems and long simulations 
  on high-performance computing clusters.
- **Interactive Visualisation**: Produces HTML outputs that facilitate interactive exploration 
  of structural changes in the system.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with ASE, scikit-learn, and other Python packages 
  to provide a comprehensive analysis environment.

CRISP’s capacity to analyze any simulation trajectory, coupled with its powerful and 
customizable analysis features, makes it an useful tool for researchers seeking to 
characterize effectively atomic and molecular behaviors within simulated systems.
